# Development Guide

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v22+ recommended)
- npm
- Git

## Initial Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start all watchers (run this in the diffagent repo)
npm run dev
```

This automatically creates the `diffagent-dev` binary, builds skills, adds `.bin` to your PATH (in `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc`), and starts five concurrent processes:

| Process | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| **parser** | `tsc --watch` on `@diffagent/parser` |
| **git** | `tsc --watch` on `@diffagent/git` |
| **cli** | `tsc --watch` on the CLI package |
| **ui** | `vite build --watch` on `@diffagent/ui` |
| **skills** | Rebuilds Claude skills on change |

If this is your first time, source your shell profile to pick up the PATH change:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc  # or ~/.bashrc
```

Then, in any git repository:

```bash
diffagent-dev
```

This opens a diff viewer for that repo's working tree changes.

## How the Dev Loop Works

### UI changes

The UI uses `vite build --watch` instead of `vite dev`. This is intentional — `vite dev` serves files from memory and never writes to disk, but the CLI server serves static files from `packages/cli/dist/ui/`. Using `vite build --watch` rebuilds the output on every change so the CLI can serve it. Refresh the browser to see changes.

### Server changes (CLI, git, parser)

`tsc --watch` recompiles TypeScript to `dist/` on save. The `diffagent-dev` binary uses `node --watch-path=packages/cli/dist` which auto-restarts the Node process when any file in `dist/` changes. The port is persisted across restarts — the server retries the same port if it's briefly held by the old process.

### How `diffagent-dev` works

`diffagent-dev` is a shell script (not a symlink) created by `scripts/link-dev.ts`. It runs:

```bash
node --watch-path=<dist-dir> <cli-entry> --no-open "$@"
```

- **Shell script, not symlink** — a symlink to `dist/index.js` would load the CLI once and never pick up server changes. The shell script wraps it with `node --watch-path` so it restarts on recompilation.
- **`--watch-path`** — restarts the process when `tsc --watch` writes new files to `dist/`.
- **`--no-open`** — prevents opening a new browser tab on every restart. Open the URL manually on first run.

### Package dependencies

```
@diffagent/ui ──► @diffagent/parser
                     ▲
@diffagent/cli ────────┤
                     │
              @diffagent/git
```

The UI builds into `packages/cli/dist/ui/` so the CLI can serve it as static files. In production, everything ships as a single `diffagent` npm package.

## Build Commands

```bash
# Full production build (all packages in dependency order)
npm run build

# Build a single package
npm run build -w @diffagent/parser
npm run build -w @diffagent/git
npm run build -w @diffagent/ui
npm run build -w diffagent
```

## Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
npm run test

# Run tests for a specific package
npm run test -w @diffagent/parser
npm run test -w @diffagent/ui

# Watch mode
npm run test:watch -w @diffagent/parser
npm run test:watch -w @diffagent/ui
```

## CLI Usage (for reference while developing)

```bash
diffagent-dev                        # Working tree changes
diffagent-dev HEAD~1                 # Last commit vs working tree
diffagent-dev HEAD~3                 # Last 3 commits vs working tree
diffagent-dev main..feature          # Compare branches
diffagent-dev --port 3000            # Custom port
```

## Troubleshooting

### Port already in use

If `diffagent-dev` fails with `EADDRINUSE`, a previous process is still running:

```bash
# Find and kill the process
lsof -i :5391
kill <PID>
```

The server retries the same port up to 30 times (15 seconds) on startup to handle the brief overlap during `--watch` restarts. But if a completely separate process holds the port, you need to kill it manually.

### Changes not showing up

1. Make sure `npm run dev` is running in the diffagent repo
2. Check that the relevant watcher (ui/cli/parser/git) isn't showing errors
3. Refresh the browser — there's no HMR in this setup
4. For server changes, wait for the `--watch` restart (you'll see the diffagent banner re-print in the terminal where `diffagent-dev` is running)
